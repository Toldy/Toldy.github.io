My job was to make the application less buggy in a first time and then, develop new features.

Cool stuff: Use of **VOIP calls**, **In-App Purchases**, **Push notifications**.

In few words... RogerVoice provides a means for the deaf and hard-of-hearing to carry out phone conversations using Text-Call technologies.
