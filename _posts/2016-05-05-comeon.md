My job was to build the iOS application from scratch with [kaliganie](https://github.com/kaliganie).

Nice stuff: Use of **CoreLocation** to track the user position and display all the people around him on a map (MapKit).

End-of-school project. Our goal was to allow people creating events very fast.
