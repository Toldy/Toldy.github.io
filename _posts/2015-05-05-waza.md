I built this app for the start-up Waza Education.

Nice stuff: **Whole applications lead**, **free to choose** any technology, first **hybrid app** (A single angular code shared for both the iOS and Android application).

In few words... Waza is a platform that matches the gap between universities and companies by providing the ecosystem to collaborate on common project.
