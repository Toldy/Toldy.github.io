I reworked the application structure, implemented design and new features (with [@pauljarysta](https://github.com/pauljarysta) and [@grifas](https://github.com/grifas)).

Nice stuff: **Collaborations** with a lot of people & advanced **Agile Software Development**.

In few words... DCRemote is an app for the clients of Etix Everywhere. It allows them to manage their datacenter perfectly and have a great overview of what is going on inside.
