I made my first mobile application with [Dewep](https://github.com/Dewep), [Victor Thiry](https://www.facebook.com/victor.thiry.42) and [Kévin Eby](https://www.facebook.com/eby.kev).

Final result not as good as expected... but here is born my ♥️ for mobile!

In few words... Agoraa is a platform which boosts the tourism, culture and business areas in cities.
